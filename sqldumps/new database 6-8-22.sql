The ways of resolving problems include: knowing the learners well, using varied strategies and techniques in teaching proper time management, seeking advice form Cooperating teacher and Student Teaching Coordinator using an Evaluation form. Demonstration Teaching is also required of the student teacher. The suggestion to improve the Pre-service teaching include increasing the number of days for Student Teaching Seminar and the topics should include Recording of Grades.
